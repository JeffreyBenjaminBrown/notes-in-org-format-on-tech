#+title: Static Files in Django, esp. for Stylesheets and Images
* code to reference
Appearances of the word "static" in polls/templates.
The entire static/ subfolder of the polls app.
* Static file discovery is weird.
** Where it is governed
"""
Django’s STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders that know how
to discover static files from various sources. One of the defaults is
AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for a “static” subdirectory in each of the
INSTALLED_APPS, like the one in polls we just created. The admin site uses the
same directory structure for its static files.
"""
** The folder structure resembles that for templates
e.g. create the file <app name>/static/<app name>/style.css,
and then refer to it as <app name>/style.css.
