#+title: Putting DNA Reads Together
* Reads are short.
Reads are on the order of 100s of bases long.
A human gene is on the order of 1000s, and we have 25K-ish genes.
* Sometimes we can use "reference genomes".

* Don't forget that the reads can come from either strand.
For this reason, try matching against both the read and the read's complement.
