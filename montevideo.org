* TODO bugs?
** DONE Should Zot use "on"?
*** It does! via `onOffEnvelope`.
*** programs in Dispatch that refer to "amp" and need changing
    if I am to use "on" together with "amp"

    Abbrevs
    Msg.Act
    Museq.Mk
    Dispatch (only in a comment)
*** why
    "on" seems to be for the benefit of Dispatch.
    So see if Zot works with Dispatch already.
    If so, the comment about "on" at the top of
      mtv-synth/Montevideo/Synth.hs
    is stale.
** write insertQuiets :: Museq -> Museq
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e3b94c1c-42f1-4754-a289-5e6f1bcf1df2
   :END:
*** why
    because monomeRecording_toMuseq in
      ~/mtv/mtv-lang/Montevideo/Dispatch/Recording
    creates events that don't have any "on=0" messages.
*** DONE try playing the simple Museq created in Test.Recording
    mtv-test/Montevideo/Test/Recording.hs
    If I'm right, even though the event is only from time 0 to 1/2, the tone will be perpetual. And that implies I should [[id:e3b94c1c-42f1-4754-a289-5e6f1bcf1df2][write insertQuiets :: Museq -> Museq]].
** How do streams work?
* TODO a DSL
  in SmSn:
  * :AIqNamXJvFITlhnI:
* TODO separate the concerns in Dispatch.Msg.Act, then make it abstract
** research: their current state
actNew, actSend, and actFree all look up a synth, which might fail.
They log errors only if there's a lookup failure.
Two of them return ways to insert or delete the synth,
  which could be factored out into a function from New or Free to synthdefs.
One creates it, one destroys it; both could be a separate super function.
*** `actNew reg (New _ name)`,
 if it finds `name`, logs an error and returns the identity.
 If it doesn't, it creates the synth (immediately -- no scheduling),
   and returns how to insert it into synth reg.
   The reg has a separate field for each different kind of synth.
 In the special case of a sampler, it also looks up the buffer.
   If founds, it uses the buffer as an argument to the sampler synth created.
*** `actFree reg when (Free _ name)`
 if it doesn't find `name` in `reg`, logs an error and returns `id`.
 If it does, it
   schedules an amp=0 message for its "when" argument,
   schedules a free message for shortly thereafter,
   and returns a way to delete the synth.
*** `actSend reg when (Send _ name msg)`,
 it doesn't find `name` in `reg`, logs an error.
 Otherwise, it schedules an action to send everythingg in `msg` at `when`.
 In the special case of a sampler receiving an "on" message,
   it schedules an "off" message for shortly thereafter.
* TODO path, high-level
** capture from the monome
   Capture synth state, chords, melodies.
* TODO JI: compare chords in EDOs
** playChord :: [JI Fraction] -> EDO -> IO ()
   This way you can edit the last argument repeatedly.
