#+title: Customizing The Django Admin Form
* refs
** For most of my notes:
in the repo
  https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/learning-aws.git
see python-web-app/polls/admin.py
* Weird: admin page is top, but each app can have an admin.py file
I guess that's because you administer all apps from the same page.
* unread: Customize the admin page look and feel w/ templates
