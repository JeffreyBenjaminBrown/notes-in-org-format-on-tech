#+title: cron (scheduling utility for *nix systems)
* PITFALLS
** req's for files in cron.d
   "must be owned by root, and must conform to run-partsâ€™ naming conventions (no dots, only letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens)."
   https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/417327
** by default, nobody but root can use cron
  But create an empty /etc/cron.deny file, and then every user can use cron.
** for Docker, must disable some kind of pam security policy
  specifically the `pam_loginuid` line in
    /etc/pam.d/crond

** how to check if the cron daemon is running
  Look for `cron` in the output of
    ps -ef
** how write/edit a cron job
*** It does not use the global PATH.
  Either modify the PATH variable defined in that file, or use the full path to the desired command, or both.
  That's because the PATH defined in the file does not necessarily match the PATH defined in the shell.
*** The primary crontab files* require user names.
   * that is, /etc/crontab and /etc/cron.d/*
   So, e.g., this doesn't work
     * * * * *      /opt/conda/bin/python /mnt/write-time.py
   Instead do something like this:
     * * * * * root /opt/conda/bin/python /mnt/write-time.py
** where to add cron jobs
  Adding files to
    /etc/cron.d/<any file>
  appears to be the preferred way.
  I can ignore /etc/crontab. (Maybe editing it would be effective, but it seems unidiomatic.)
