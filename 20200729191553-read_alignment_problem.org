** The Global Alignment Problem
*** = finding a short pattern in a long text.
** The Local Alignment Problem
*** = finding the most similar pair of substrings from two strings.
*** Incredibly, the solution is nearly identical to the DP solution to the global alignment problem.
**** The two differences:
***** In the penalty matrix, make the diagonal > 0, the penalties < 0.
***** Start the traceback at any maximal value (not just in the last row), and work backward only until the first 0.
**** Most of the alignment matrix will be 0.
