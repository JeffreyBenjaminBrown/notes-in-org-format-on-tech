** wash pads
  pads can be cleaned easily by disassembling the unit and washing only the pads with soap and water. let them dry completely prior to reassembly

** stack buttons-to-buttons
  because the oil that went into the wood can damage the keypads.
** clean board with baking soda water
  very mostly water
