#+title: Measuring The Space of Sequences
* ways sequences can differ
** mismatch|substitution
= they differ in a spot
** insertion|deletion
= one has an extra base pair inserted somewhere that the other doesn't.
* distance measures on the space of sequences
** Hamming distance
 =  minimum number of substitutions to transform one into the other.
** edit distance | Levenshtein distance
 =  minimum number of substitutions to transform one into the other,
where an edit is either an insertion, a deletion or a substitution.
