can nonetheless be important, thanks to backlinks
* REMEMBER the Discourse group
* surprise & how it works
** link descriptions are automatically refactored
*** maybe only in a newer version than the one I use?
*** this can be disabled:
https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/links-descriptions-auto-refactoring/710/3?u=jeffbrown
** DONE (learned) linking to headers
*** only available in version 1.2
*** create header, then run `org-roam-store-link` (C-c L)
*** insert it with org-insert-link                (C-c C-l)
 This is part of org-mode, not org-roam.
*** this has no link
** a backlink is not visible until saved
that is, by saving the file that contains the backlink,
after creating the backlink
** To use a weird symbol (e.g. '\' or ',') in an alias
Enclose the whole tag in parens.
Write '\' as \\.
* TODO convert to org-roam v2
  https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/the-org-roam-v2-great-migration/1505
* TODO tweak
** TODO use Nix to install org-roam
*** TODO PITFALL: must first procedurally uninstall org-roam
and whatever dependencies were installed as a result (e.g. emacssql-sqlite3).
*** TODO Matthew Piziak uses overrides, which looks easier than overlays
https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/theres-a-docker-image-available/331/4?u=jeffbrown
*** tried, failed: using a Nix overlay for Emacs
I do not understand overlays
** TODO update Docker image for org-roam v. 1.2
** TODO can I make more TODO-like tags for org-mode?
** TODO how to tab-complete from the middle?
** TODO how to rename a file?
 particularly if I can't tab-complete from the middle
