* TODO Dividing files by repo (the SmSn "source" concept)
** TODO Write some UI code to ask which source
** TODO merge tech and music
and ofiscal? into a single public database.
Move files only if they're private.
** The hard way
Upon making a file, immediately move it to the repo it belongs in, then rebuild the db.
If the file was created in the course of linking to it from another,
delete that link, then recreate it, so it links to the new place.
