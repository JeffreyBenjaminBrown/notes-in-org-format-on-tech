* TODO make a table of many thanos reports
** TODO implement a "correction" phase to the fret calculations
   Once the program has chosen fret positions for all harmonics,
   revise them such that if any can be adjusted to be closer on average to the others, it is.
   Keep revising until that can't be done to anything. (Hopefully there are no cycles.)
** TODO compute through the 15-limit, including 9
   f n = ( n,
        map round . take 5 . map (\(_,(_,_,err)) -> err) . bests $ n )
   myPrint $ map f [31 .. 120]
** TODO add harmonic justice to the report
   This will make filtering the report more useful.
** *all* the thanos tunings for spacing between say 1\12 and 5\12.
** Then try various filters on that.
* TODO ? find all 8-string-ish thanos tunings for an edo
  (That is, strings 0 through 7.)

  Let s' = edo / 7 -- s' as in close to the spacing
  Let s = a few integers on either side of s'.
  Let o' = (s * 7). -- o' as in close to the octave
  Compute m = edo - o'.
  If m and s are relatively prime,
    show at the thanos tuning for edo, modulus = m, spacing = s.
* TODO collect intervals automatically
* TODO search over all moduli
up to, say, 16
* TODO filter by max-12-edo distance
** TODO make including the octave optional for computing maximum stretch.
 For instance, 22\84 mod 5 works astoundingly well if one ignores that.
* TODO filter by fret size
* TODO filter by MSE of the EDO
