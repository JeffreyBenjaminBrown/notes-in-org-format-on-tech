#+title: How TPC Distributes the Corporate Income Tax (paper)
~/of/papers/How-TPC-...
* TODO RESUME p. 2 (really the third page) last paragraph
* stakeholders
  shareholders, other capital income recipients, workers, consumers
* return to capital is largely from supernormal returns
  "a substantial share of the return to corporate capital is from “supernormal” returns, the returns to successful risk taking, inframarginal returns, and economic rents in excess of the “normal” return (the riskless return to waiting)"
* international capital mobility shifts some of ("the"?) corporate tax burden to labor
  "international capital mobility shifts some of the corporate income tax burden on the normal return from corporate capital to labor"
** TODO The "normal" in that sentence confuses me.
* share breakdown
** 20 labor, 20 normal returns, 60 supernormal returns
   "TPC now treats 20 percent of the corporate income tax burden as falling on labor, 20 percent on the normal return to all capital, and 60 percent on the supernormal returns to corporate equity (shareholders)."
** they split the "normal return" 50/50
*** restated in detail
   "We now also distinguish the incidence of changes in the corporate income tax that affect only the normal return, such as changes in cost recovery rules, which we distribute 50 percent to labor and 50 percent to the normal return to all capital."
*** examples
    Changes in cost recovery provisions
**** TODO understand this
     "As a result, an increase in corporate revenues due, for example, to scaling back accelerated depreciation would be less progressive than the baseline corporate tax, for which the burden on labor is only 20 percent."
** 60% is a lowball estimate
   "We use the low end of the range of recent estimates for this “supernormal” share, 60 percent, and assign it only to shareholders."
** distinguishing normal and supernormal returns
* short-run changes fall only on shareholders
  "In addition, for short-run analyses of changes in the corporate income tax we now treat all of the burden as falling on shareholders"
  "the long-run distribution [unlike the short-term one] ... takes account of shifting of capital to the non-corporate sector and overseas to avoid the tax."
  "the short-run distribution of a corporate tax change is [therefore] more progressive than the long-run distribution"
* tax incidence can come through price hikes as well as drops in income
* TODO understand
  "The [corporate income] tax applies to corporate equity returns, because workers’ earnings, interest paid to bondholders and other lenders, and other business costs are deductible in computing taxable profits."
* tax inncentives
  "Shifting investment (capital) from corporate to noncorporate businesses could reduce returns to noncorporate investors, for example, and shifting investment abroad could reduce wages for domestic workers."
