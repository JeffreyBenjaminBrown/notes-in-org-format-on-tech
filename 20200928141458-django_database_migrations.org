#+title: Django Database Migrations
* run `python manage.py makemigrations <app-name>`
THis writes a "migration",
a human-readable file that describes how the DB changed,
to `<app-name>/migrations/0001_initial.py`.
* if desired, check the migration
View the SQL it translates into:
  python manage.py sqlmigrate <app-name> 0001
Check for problems automatically:
  python manage.py check
* execute (all pending?) migration(s)
python manage.py migrate
(the same command as before)
