#+title: NixOS, how to upgrade
This worked, going from 19.09 to 20.03.
* Tweak configuration .nix file(s)
  per the release notes for the latest NixOS version.
** PITFALL: Seems to mean more than just reading the backward incompatibilities section.
   While trying to migrate to 21.05, I'm also reading
   "B.1.4. Other Notable Changes",
   because it starts by saying that stdenv.lib will break.
* PITFALL: sudo is important for the rest of this
A lot of it will run without sudo,
but thereby create stuff that lives in userspace,
and is for some reason therefore unuseable.
* update the channel
** first check that it's where it should be
sudo nix-channel --list
*** which should give something like this
nixos https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-19.09
** sudo nix-channel --add <channel>
for instance,
  sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-20.03 nixos
** sudo nix-channel --update
* rebuild
sudo nixos-rebuild --upgrade boot
