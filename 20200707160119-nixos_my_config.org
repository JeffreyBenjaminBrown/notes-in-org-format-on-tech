#+title: NixOS, my config
* TODO ? I lost my .stack/config.yaml file
  I had configured it for something ... maybe this, which also appears in my local stack.yaml files?
```
nix:
  enable: true
```
* TODO ? unfinished from 20.09 installation
** transfer from from the old (20.03) configuration.nix
  boot.extraModulePackages = [
      config.boot.kernelPackages.exfat-nofuse ];
  system.autoUpgrade.enable = true;
** ? transfer from the auto-generated configuration.nix file
currently saved at
  jbb-config/install-20.09/by-nixos-generate-config/configuration.nix
I'm not sure I want any of that stuff; I don't know what most of it is.
* PITFALL : switchingo to unstable killed my system
I had to reinstall the OS before I could nixos-rebuild again.
Although I eventually found I could install new stuff with `nix-env -i`.

* PITFALL: to record video with camera and mic
I use a separate NixOS config,
which uses PulseAudio to feed the mic into [[file:20200707152447-cheese.org][cheese]]
* PITFALL: my config outside of .nix files
