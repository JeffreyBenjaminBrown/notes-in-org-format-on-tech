#+title: Longer Reads Reduce The Problem Of Ambiguous Repetitive Sequences. (Bioinformatics)
**** Why they help.
***** Ideally, a read spans all the repeats and some context.
 Then there is no ambiguity.
***** Still good: a read spans all the repeats.
 It does not have to include their totality, just some of all of them.
 Over-collapse then becomes impossible in the SES algorithm.
****** TODO I don't understand why this matters, since we don't use the SES algorithm.
**** Paired end sequencing.
