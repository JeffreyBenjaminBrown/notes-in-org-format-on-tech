#+title: Apache and mod_wsgi: using them with Django
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/
* some definitions
** Apache is a web server
** mod_wsgi is an Apache module 
 which can host any Python WSGI application, including Django.
* Apache config files
** are located at /etc/apache2
at least in my docker container
** what to customize
*** ports
The default `ports.conf` listens to port 80 and not 8000.
I'm adding a "Listen 8000" line to it.
** PITFALL: *start* apache, and do some stuff before that
*** first: `source /etc/apache2/envvars`
This sets APACHE_RUN_DIR.
*** then start it: `apache2`
Most of the introductions don't talk about this, as if it runs automatically,
but I think I have to manually start it. The command is just "apache2".
