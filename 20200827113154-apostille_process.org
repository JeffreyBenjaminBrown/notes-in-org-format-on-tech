** TODO file this stuff
*** Things the [[file:../tech/20200824142405-michigan_office_of_the_great_seal.org][Michigan Office of the Great Seal]] said
 Only option is mail-in service. 
 Request from msu a certified notarized copy of (?). 
 Use authentication request form. 
 They'll certify either form, diploma or certificate of graduation. 
 International destination is fine. 
 They prefer check, to state of michigan. 
 They prefer to receive everything together.
*** TODO asking Holly at the MSU Registrar about everything.
**** Is the normal process the following?
Send the diploma and a stamped self-addressed envelope to MSU.
Also this: https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/OGS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUEST_FORM_654334_7.pdf
and a check to the SOS for a dollar.
Have them certify and send it on to the SOS.
Have the SOS apostille it, put it in the envelope and drop it in the mail.
**** Apostilles be had for certificates of graduation.
The SOS will certify anything.
**** Sending to an international destination will take forever.
Better to send to someone in the US, who sends me a PDF.
Better yet would be to have the SOS create and email the PDF.
***** TODO Ask the SOS if they'll do that.
*** Rhonda Miller said she can make a certified copy of the diploma.
*** Apostille (by SOS) first requires certification (by MSU)
That is, apostille by Michigan SOS Office of the Great Seal
requires certification by MSU's Registrar.
** Getting a "certified copy" (from MSU) and the "apostille" (from Michigan SOS) are separate processes.
** MSU can forward envelopes and checks to SOS
