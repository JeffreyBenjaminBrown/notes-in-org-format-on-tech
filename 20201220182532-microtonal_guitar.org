** zipties 
*** advice from others
   Use needlenose pliers to crimp the tie at the corners where it bends around the fretboard.
   Use them also to tighten.
   Trimming the fret-like portion of the ziptie on the bridge side with scissors can help. (Don't trim the side that you fret because that would change the intonation.)
*** TODO How to make them grip better?
    Score the back of the neck?
    Put grip liner under them?
