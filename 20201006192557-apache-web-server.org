#+title: Apache (web server)
* Apache is a web server
* Apache config files
** PITFALL: Comments in Apache config files
 cannot trail code on the same line,
 although they can trail whitespace.
 (This is at least true for `ports.conf`.)
** are located at /etc/apache2
at least in my docker container
** what to customize
*** ports
The default `ports.conf` listens to port 80 and not 8000.
I'm adding a "Listen 8000" line to it.
* to start Apache
** run `service apache2 start`
or, in a tax.co Docker container, from /etc/apache2, run
  ./start-apache.sh
*** Otherwise I get the error that `DefaultRuntimeDir` is not set.
 In the default apache2.conf file, there's this line:
   DefaultRuntimeDir ${APACHE_RUN_DIR}
 but APACHE_RUN_DIR is not set,
 and it's nowhere in code for the official Apache docker `httpd` image.
