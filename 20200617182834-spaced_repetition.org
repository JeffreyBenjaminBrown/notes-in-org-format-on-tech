** keeping JACK happy
*** Killing SC before the GHCI process makes Jack err.
*** don't leave Spotify open (even if not playing) when turning Qjackctl
    not sure but maybe bad
** git and big text moves
*** before moving a complicated thing in a git repo
    consider whether I can move its definition to its own file.
    If so, do that, and then just move the reference to the new file.
    That way the diff is more readable.
*** if I can't, push my changes just before and just after any such move
    Otherwise, checking the diff is a nightmare.
    I'll have forgotten what I was doing,
    *and* once I realize I'm looking at a move,
    I have to search for each moved line.
** Does meta awareness stop pointless behaviors?
